# Jerryrat - A rich collection of uniqueness

People are experiencing a variety of passages of lives and have finally shaped what they are today, so did us, each one of us at Jerryrat. This year, we will be down to explore the application of marketing science in the banking industry, where there is a large pool of diverse client individuals. Therefore, it is crucially important to have capable cooperators, like us, who share common goals to reach further in the product perfectness while bring in diverse perspectives and viewpoints from our unique mindsets and varying backgrounds.

# Team Backgrounds & Our Strengths

Sharing the same major in Computer Science, we are pursuing similar but also different trajectories. Angelo and John, as stduents majoring in Mathematics at the same time, they provide valuable munerical insights into the mathematical optimization which is a bonus point when it comes to addressing the model efficiency. While we also experienced different industry paths. John has empirical practice at a Startup as a software developer. He Was responsible for speech to word and semantic recognition part for an intra-company platform's search engine, and used multiple techs. The NLP expertise is transferrable to the modeling of campaigining data optimization. For Angelo, he has multiple internship experience at large tech corporate, and could help formalize the general app architecture and establish professional industry workflow. Besides, his background dev expertise boosts up the dev cycle flow and will largely accelerate the development progress.
