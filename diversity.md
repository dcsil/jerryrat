# Team Backgrounds & Our Strengths

Angelo and John, as stduents majoring in Mathematics at the same time, they provide valuable munerical insights into the mathematical optimization which is a bonus point when it comes to addressing the model efficiency. While we also experienced different industry paths. John has empirical practice at a Startup as a software developer. He Was responsible for speech to word and semantic recognition part for an intra-company platform's search engine, and used multiple techs. The NLP expertise is transferrable to the modeling of campaigining data optimization.
