People are experiencing a variety of passages of lives and have finally shaped what they are today, so did us, each one of us at Jerryrat. This year, we will be down to explore the application of marketing science in the banking industry, where there is a large pool of diverse client individuals. Therefore, it is crucially important to have capable cooperators, like us, who share common goals to reach further in the product perfectness while bring in diverse perspectives and viewpoints from our unique mindsets and varying backgrounds.
