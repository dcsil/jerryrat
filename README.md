Our team name "JerryRat" is inspired by ["tomcat"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat) is a free and open-source software which provides a HTTP web server environment written in Java which scripts in Java can run on. Additionally, there is a famous cartoon ["Tom and Jerry"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry), we invert the name of "TomCat" to "JerryCat" with this cartoon. It looks cute, isn't it? :)
