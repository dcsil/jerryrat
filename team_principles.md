# Team Principles

## Communication:

- All teammates will communicate primarily in a private channel named #jerrycat
- The Slack channel will be a platform for work-related chats along with sharing media and code blocks
- While asking about specific features/source codes, the person should also add the link to the commit history.
- While referring to features responsible by a specific teammate, the person should ping this teammate in case the message is missed.
- For the discussion related to the same issue, please reply in thread instead of sending a new message.
- We expect everyone to check the channel at least twice a day.

## Meetings:

- We will hold meetings every Thursday afternoon.
- Group meetings may sometimes occur in Zoom or Slack depending on situation.
- It is mandatory for everyone to attend the meetings once the logistics are finialized. Absence is acceptable upon prior notice on the channel.
- There should be a topic for each meeting regarding the progress or issues.
- Rescheduling is only confirmed with a universal consensus by all members on a revised meeting date and time.
- When necessary, it is applicable to schedule separate meetings by different members. For example, two members are responsible for the same feature and they may sometimes have sync-up meetings to discuss the progress.

## Work:

- Tea members should form a support net for one another to address issue together.
- Work delegation should be documented and discussed in the first team meeting.
- The project should be broken down into few milestones and work tasks will be confirmed by phases.
- We will use Zenhub to create new work tickets, do the work assignment and track the progress.
- In case of critical issues or extremely time-consuming tasks, non-responsible teammates could intervene and provide assistance, and the milestone should be changed accordingly.
