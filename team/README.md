Team leader
---

Our team leader is [Zhuoheng (Angelo) Huang](./zhuoheng_huang.md), an experienced developer in backend and cloud computing. He has rich experience in past internships and also demonstrates leadership in those positions as well as in our current project initiative, so we elect him to be the current team leader and will be responsible for the sketch of general outline and some backend development tasks. We expect him to keep on the bar and contribute massively along with others at Jerryrat.
